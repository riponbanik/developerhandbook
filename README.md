# About

This is the source code repository for my blog, [DeveloperHandbook.com](https://www.developerhandbook.com). My blog has been my personal space since 2013 to teach myself through teaching others. The blog was originally hosted through Wordpress, and has now been migrated to be a statically generated site using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

# Contributing

As is the nature of software developmenet and our industry especially, things change. At the time of writing each post, everything detailed in that post was accurate to the best of my ability. Should you encounter and mistakes or issues with a post, you now have the ability through submitting pull requests to fix those issues.

All blog posts are written in markdown, and can be found in [/src/pages](https://github.com/jpreecedev/developerhandbook/tree/master/src/pages).

Please create an issue to start conversation about any changes you wish to make before submitting a pull request.

# The future

Now that the site has had a little bit of love, care, and attention, the plan is to continue blogging and giving back to the community who has given me so much throughout my career.
