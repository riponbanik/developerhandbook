Last year I set out to try and diversify myself and learn new things. I have focused primarily on software development for at least the last 13 years, and this year I wanted to do something different. I shied away from reading software development books and started reading sci-fi books, books of historical importance, fantasy, and yes the occasional development book when I felt the urge. Here are some of the books I read during 2014 (in no particular order);

- Harry Potter Complete Series ([Book 1](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYME/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYME&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=CGH6CIBGSFEEDRMH "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Book 1) "), [Book 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYII/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYII&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=PT4TOGJUF7CP4ZTQ 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2) '), [Book 3](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYQ0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYQ0&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=C5TL6ANY33PV66VC 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3) '), [Book 4](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYBA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYBA&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=X24GBYIDPU26BCHS 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book 4) '), [Book 5](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYJM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYJM&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=JOOG6OULY3E7D7QZ 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)'), [Book 6](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DYGA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DYGA&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=AC4ULNTSYNRLIAWI 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6) '), [Book 7](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00728DY60/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00728DY60&linkCode=as2&tag=jprecom-21&linkId=NFY6D445TSYAYLZL 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7) '))

There are 21 books listed above (1 or 2 have been excluded for personal reasons). How did I manage to read so many books in 1 year? The key is consistency. Read for between 1-2 hours a day, and try not to stop reading mid-chapter where possible. Reading is good for the mind and is an excellent way of relaxing and destressing, which is very important for your general health and wellbeing. Sorry I know there are a lot of Amazon affiliate links in this post...but every author gets one of these a year! :)
